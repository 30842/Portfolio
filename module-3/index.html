    <h1 style="color: pink;">Laser Cutting</h1>

    <div class="assignment">
        
        <p>Laser cutting is a manufacturing process that uses a high-powered laser beam to cut through materials such as metal, wood, plastic, glass, and various other materials. The laser beam is typically generated by a laser resonator and focused through a series of mirrors or lenses onto the material being cut.
<br>
            The intense heat generated by the laser beam melts, burns, or vaporizes the material, creating a precise and clean cut. Laser cutting is known for its accuracy, speed, and versatility. It can be used to cut intricate shapes, patterns, and designs with high precision, making it a popular choice for various industries such as manufacturing, automotive, aerospace, electronics, and crafting. Additionally, laser cutting is often used for prototyping, custom fabrication, and mass production due to its efficiency and repeatability.
        <br>
        Cardboard, MDF (medium-density fiberboard), and acrylic are commonly used materials in laser cutting for various purposes:
<br>
    <b>Cardboard:</b>
     <br>Prototyping: Cardboard is often used for rapid prototyping due to its affordability and ease of cutting. It allows designers to quickly iterate and test ideas.
   <br>Packaging: Laser-cut cardboard is used for creating custom packaging inserts, boxes, and displays. It offers precise cuts for tailored packaging solutions.
    <br>Arts and Crafts: Cardboard is popular in arts and crafts projects, such as creating models, sculptures, and decorative items. Laser cutting enables intricate designs and precise detailing.
   <br> <b>MDF (Medium-Density Fiberboard):</b>
   <br>Furniture Making: MDF is commonly used in furniture making for items like cabinets, shelves, and decorative panels. Laser cutting allows for precise shaping of MDF pieces, including intricate patterns and designs.
   <br> Architectural Models: MDF is often used in architectural modeling for creating scaled-down representations of buildings and structures. Laser cutting enables accurate reproduction of architectural details.
     <br>Signage: MDF can be used for indoor signage applications. Laser cutting allows for the creation of custom signage with intricate lettering and designs.
   <br><b> Acrylic:</b>
   <br>Signage and Displays: Acrylic is widely used for creating signage, displays, and point-of-sale materials. Laser cutting produces clean edges and precise shapes, making acrylic ideal for showcasing branding and information.
   <br> Jewelry and Accessories: Acrylic is popular in jewelry making and accessories due to its versatility and aesthetic appeal. Laser cutting enables the creation of intricate jewelry pieces and accessories.
     <br> Prototyping: Acrylic is often used in product prototyping for its transparency and ease of cutting. Laser cutting allows for rapid iteration and refinement of product designs.

        <h2>Assignment 1</h2>
        <p> Step 1: Designing in Fusion 360

           <br> Create a New Design: Open Fusion 360 and start a new design project.
           <br> Sketching: Use the sketch tools to draw the outline of your welcome board design. You can create intricate patterns, add text, or incorporate graphics as desired.

           <br> Fine-tuning: Adjust the dimensions, angles, and details of your design as needed to achieve the desired aesthetic.
           <br> Step 2: Preparing for Laser Cutting
            
           <br> Exporting the Design: Once your design is finalized, export it as a compatible file format for laser cutting machines, such as DXF or SVG.
           <br> Material Selection: Choose the appropriate material for your welcome board, such as wood, acrylic, or metal. Ensure that the material is suitable for laser cutting.
           <br> Machine Setup: Prepare the laser cutting machine by selecting the correct material settings and adjusting the focus and power settings based on the material thickness.
           <br> Loading Material: Securely place the chosen material onto the laser cutting bed, ensuring it is flat and properly aligned.
           <br> Step 3: Laser Cutting
            
           
           <br> Start Cutting: Once satisfied with the test cut, initiate the cutting process. The laser cutter will follow the outline of your design, accurately cutting out the welcome board shape.
           <br> Quality Check: After cutting is complete, carefully inspect the welcome board for any rough edges or imperfections. Make any necessary adjustments to the cutting parameters if needed.</p>

    <h2>Assignment 2</h2>
    <p>Step 1: Designing the Logo on Fusion 360

       <br> Sketching the Design: Begin by sketching the outline of the table on Fusion 360, considering dimensions, cardboard thickness, and structural stability.
      
       <br> Adding Details: Enhance the design with intricate details such as cutouts, engravings, or folding lines to optimize assembly.
       <br> Testing and Refinement: Validate the design virtually, simulating its performance to identify and address any potential issues or improvements.
       <br> Exporting the Design: Export the finalized design in a compatible file format (such as .dxf or .svg) for laser cutting.
       <br> Step 2: Preparing for Laser Cutting
        
       <br> Material Selection: Choose high-quality cardboard suitable for laser cutting, ensuring it is flat and free from creases or damage.
   <br>Importing the Design: Import the exported design file into the laser cutting software, ensuring proper scaling and alignment on the cardboard. </p>
