        <p>Welcome to the documentation for web development. In this guide, you will find comprehensive information about the various aspects of web development</p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>What is Web Development?<br>
            Web development refers to the process of building and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves several disciplines, including web design, front-end development, back-end development, and web server configuration. Web developers use a combination of programming languages, frameworks, and tools to create functional and visually appealing websites.</p>

        <p>This documentation serves as a guide for creating forms in web development.
             Forms are essential elements of web applications that allow users to input data and interact with websites.
              In this guide, you will learn how to create forms using HTML and enhance them with CSS and JavaScript.
           <br> HTML Form Structure<br>
            To create a basic form in HTML, you use the' form 'element along with various input elements such as text fields, email fields, text areas, and dropdown menus.</p>

        <p>Creating a digital resume on a web page offers a unique opportunity to showcase your skills and experiences in an engaging and interactive format. </p>
       <br> HTML tags like 'img' are utilized to display images within the resume, allowing users to showcase their portfolio, projects, or personal branding. The 'img' tag requires the src attribute to specify the image file's source and the alt attribute to provide alternative text for accessibility purposes.
